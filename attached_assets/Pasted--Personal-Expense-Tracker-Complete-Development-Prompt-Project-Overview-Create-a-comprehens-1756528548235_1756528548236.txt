## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
Users Table: id, username, email, password_hash, created_at
Expenses Table: id, user_id, amount, category_id, date, description, payment_method
Categories Table: id, name, icon, color, user_id
Budgets Table: id, user_id, category_id, amount, period, start_date
Income Table: id, user_id, amount, source, date, description
```

### Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF tokens
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Session security
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

### Performance Optimization
- Database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Caching mechanisms
- Image compression for receipts
- Minification of CSS/JavaScript
- CDN usage for static assets
